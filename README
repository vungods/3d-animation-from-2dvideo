# Project README

# Overview
This repository provides a streamlined process for converting 2D images into dynamic 3D objects with animations. Follow the steps below to seamlessly integrate 2D images into a fully rigged 3D model with animations.

# Step 1: Importing 2D Images
- Start by utilizing the `PIFulHD_Demo.ipynb` file, which serves as the entry point for importing 2D images.
- The output of this step will be a sophisticated 3D file in the .fbx format, ready for further enhancements.

# Step 2: Generating 3D Objects with Human Bones
- Head to [Mixamo](https://www.mixamo.com/), a powerful online platform for creating 3D characters with intricate skeletal structures.
- Utilize Mixamo's capabilities to integrate human bones into your 3D object, providing a realistic and dynamic foundation.

# Step 3: Creating 3D Objects with Animations
- Leverage the capabilities of [Plask](https://plask.ai/), a cutting-edge tool for generating 3D objects with animations.
- Follow the step-by-step guide on Plask to breathe life into your 3D model, incorporating captivating animations.

# Additional Notes
- Ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed before executing each step.
- Experiment with different 2D images and customization options to tailor the 3D model to your specific requirements.
- Feel free to explore and tweak parameters in both Mixamo and Plask to achieve the desired visual and animated effects.
